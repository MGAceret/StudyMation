<!-- Features created for users -->
## Features
- **Dynamic Timeline Scrubber:** Automatically bounds to the active Start-End loop points.
- **Precision Frame Skipping:** Skip forward or backward by ±1 frame or jump by ±5 frames
- **Relative and Absolute Frame Counter:** Displays live frame numbers currently played, or counts relative cycle progress according to the active loops.
- **Start-End Range Looper:** Continuously loops a selected segment until it is cleared.
- **Horizontal Video Flip:** Flips the video on the X-axis with the use of `Mirror` to evaluate composition balance and silhouttes.
- **Rule of Thirds Grid Overlay:** Injects a 3x3 compositional grid for analyzing framing and staging.
- **Variable Playback Speeds:** Switch between `0.25x`, `0.5x`, `1.0x` with smooth active transitions.

<!-- Recommendations -->
## Recommendations
- **Ad Awareness:** Currently, the HUD does not automatically hide during the pre-roll ads. It is recommended to use an ad-blocker or wait until the video starts to avoid tracking ad timestamps.
- **Draggable Positioning (Planned):** Allow repositioning of the HUD anywhere on the video player.
- **Collapsible to Mini-Mode (Planned):** Provides a compact toggle to minimize the HUD into a slim frame counter for a clearer view.

<!-- Programming Languages used -->
## Tech Stack
- **JavaScript** — Pure Vanilla DOM manipulation and Media APIs
- **CSS** — Design for the HUD
- **Manifest V3** — Modern Chrome Extension Standard
